Throughout the project, we acquired practical insights into harnessing
 the capabilities of C++ to construct a robust line management system. 
Central to our development process was the adept utilization of various 
standard libraries such as `<fstream>` and `<vector>`, which facilitated
 seamless file operations and efficient data storage, respectively. 
By meticulously organizing our code into classes and namespaces, 
we ensured a structured and comprehensible codebase, fostering maintainability 
and scalability. Moreover, our utilization of modern C++ features, 
including lambdas and range-based for loops, not only enhanced code 
readability but also promoted concise and expressive programming 
practices. These features allowed us to tackle complex tasks with 
ease, simplifying our implementation while maintaining robustness.
 Furthermore, our exploration of error handling mechanisms, such 
as exceptions and clear error messaging, equipped us with the 
tools necessary to handle unforeseen runtime issues gracefully, 
enhancing the overall reliability of our system. In essence, the 
project provided us with practical skills and methodologies for 
crafting well-structured, efficient, and reliable C++ solutions 
tailored for real-world applications.
